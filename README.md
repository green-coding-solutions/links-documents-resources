  + OLEDs consume less energy on red colors and and in dark mode. But negligeable and if movement occurs it is gone
  Smartphone WIFI consumes most wattage. But it may take the least amount of time! So WattH is smallest!

## Tools

- [Carbon clock](https://conf.researchr.org/series/ict4s)
- [EnRoads Tool](https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=22.1.0)
  + Tool developed by Climate Interactive in Coop with MIT
  + Mainly build as a showcase and education tool to simulate climate policies
  + Basic display is Energy Sources and GHG Emissions and Temperature Rise
  + You can see many graphs and levers. But before every model it makes sense to dive into the "assumptions".
  + Free Courses to spread the word: https://learn.climateinteractive.org/
- [Electricitymap.org](https://electricitymap.org)
  + See the current CO2 intensity of the grid
- [FlexiDAO](https://www.flexidao.com/)
  + See if your current electricity is Green. Down to energy provider level. And also including matching with vendors.
